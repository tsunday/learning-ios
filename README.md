# Learing iOS by backend developer

## Day One

**What learned**:
- basic types
- flow control
- functions and closures
- classes
- protocols and extensions
- error handling

**Conclusion**

Swift is much safer language than Python. Type inference is not allowing to change tyhe type of a declared variable. In Python's dynamic typing it can be changed anytime. Plus there are no constant variables in Python.

Protocols and Extensions are also pretty nice features.
